# simon-game

In this project, I created an online version of the Simon Game.

The languages used were HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I made this game with 2 months of web development knowledge so the JS was challenging. But in the end it worked out, and I'm proud of this project :)

Ps: The game is in Portuguese-BR.
