## Simon-game ðŸŽ®

In this project, I created an online version of the <b>Simon Game</b>.

I made this game with 2 months of web development knowledge so the JS was challenging. But in the end it worked out, and I'm proud of this project :)

<b>Technologies used:</b> 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Obs: The game is in Portuguese-BR.
